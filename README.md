 The goals with this project were as follows:
 
 - To modify Lazer Defender's gameplay logic and graphics to work on a 16:9 canvas for Console and PC platforms.
 
 - To add in light Bullet hell mechanics like one-hit kill enemies, and 1 super tough Enemy(boss) that soaks up bullets.
 
 - To add support for DualShock™ 4 on PS4™ (Analog stick and D-Pad)
 
 - Make controls more responsive. (for ex, reading in Horizontal and Vertical input via GetAxisRaw)
